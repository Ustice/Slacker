### Slacker is a bot for [Slack](https://slack.com) built on the Node.js platform.

  Slacker processes Slack WebHook requests and executes pre-defined actions before responding to Slack. It deals with the networking aspects of your bot so you can focus on functionality.

## Setup

  1. Clone this repository.

````
➜ ~ git clone git@github.com:chris--young/Slacker.git
````

  2. Install [Node.js](http://node.js).

  3. Set Slack Integrations.

  * Create a Outgoing WebHook in Slack and point it to your instance of Slacker.

    * Slacker expects to receive requests directly to the server's root URL.

    * Be sure to include a valid `key` URL parameter on your outgoing-webhook URL when you set it in Slack.

  * Create an Incoming WebHook in Slack. 

    * Be sure to update `hostname` and `path` in `config.json` in match your incoming-webhook.

  4. Start Slacker.

````
➜ ~ sh Slacker 
````

## Actions

  Actions are script files located in the `bot_actions` directory. When Slacker receives a request from Slack it will check for and execute the appropriate action. Actions receive a `data` object with relevant information about the request from Slack, process the data and then return a response string. Slacker facilitates the response process.

### Creating an Action

  1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `bot_actions` directory.

  2. Require the `bot` module.

  3. Define your action as an object.

  4. Call `bot.addAction()` to complete the process. Slacker will search the `bot_actions` directory and add valid actions on start up.

### A Sample Action

  ````
  var bot = require(__dirname + '/../bot.js')

  var action = {
    trigger: 'echo',

    setup: function() {
      // This method will be run at server start up.
    },

    execute: function(data) {
      return data.text.replace(this.trigger, '')
    }
  }

  bot.addAction(action)
  ````

#### Triggers

  Your action's `trigger` attribute defines when it will be exectued. If a Slack user activates your bot with the `trigger` keyword in his message text Slacker will perform your action. `trigger` attributes should be unique; Slacker will ignore actions if their `trigger` attributes have already been defined by another action.

#### Setup

  The `setup()` method will be run when Slacker worker processes come online. You can use this method for any pre-execution logic you may need to perform.

#### Execute

  Slacker calls the `execute()` method when a request requires that your action be performed. It receives a single `data` parameter with relavent request information and must return a string which will be the bot's response in Slack.

##### The `data` Object

  ````
  var data = {
    team_id: 'T028JNZFM',
    team_domain: 'mobdev',
    channel_id: 'C02DCNQRN',
    channel_name: 'slacker-testing',
    timestamp: '1405215092.000210',
    user_id: 'U02A1R3PM',
    user_name: 'chris_young',
    text: 'echo foo'
  }
  ````

## Tests

  Slacker uses [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mocha) for testing. To run the tests first install Mocha.

  ````
  ➜ ~ npm install -g mocha
  ````

  Then run the tests.

  ````
  ➜ ~ npm test
  ````
